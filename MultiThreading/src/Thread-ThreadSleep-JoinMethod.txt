Thread sleep() mathod
----------------------
public static void sleep(long milliSeconds) throws InterruptedException
public static void sleep(long milliSeconds, int nanos) throws InterruptedException

*It is used to put a thread to sleep for some time, so that another threads get a chance to execute.


Note: 
getName(): returns the string passed through constructor.
Thread.isAlive(): status of a thread.
Thread.currentThread.isAlive(): status of current thread.



Join() method
--------------

The join method waits for a thread to terminate.
It causes the currently running thread to stop executing.
Until thread on which join method method is called finished its task.
Overall. means we can finish thread and then we can start another new thread.


join() method versions
-----------------------

1. public void join() throws InterruptedException
2. public void join(long milliSeconds) throws InterruptedException
3. public void join(long milliSeconds, int nanos) throws InterruptedException

*The scond and third versions of join() method wait for the thread to wait for a given time before it dies.


Problem with the simple join() method
--------------------------------------
It may take another thread wait for a long time till this thread get finished.
So, we can specify some max amount that can be given to the thread with the join method
and threads can have that given time for execution to complete.
